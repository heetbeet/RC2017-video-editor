# File structure

You have to fill these directories yourself:

F:\\no\_spaces\\RC_Program\\WinPython-32bit-3.5.3.1Zero\\\*

F:\\no\_spaces\\RC_Program\\VLCPortable\\\*

F:\\no\_spaces\\RC_Program\\sublime\\\*


Winpython version is currently fixed: http://winpython.github.io/

Sublime version is the portable version: https://www.sublimetext.com/3

VLC has to be version 2.0.8 or older (quite a hasstle to get right): https://portableapps.com/news/2013-07-30--vlc-media-player-portable-2.0.8-released

(you may have to download the bins of 2.0.8 and extract it into a newer portable-app folder for it to work)

This is an example of a project directory:

F:\\no\_spaces\\howe_force\*

you have to provide an approproate video (of any *.avi, *.mkv, or *.mp4 filename) in the directory:

F:\\no\_spaces\\howe_force\video

along with the appropriate slides (as filenames 000.png, 001.png, 002.png, etc.)

F:\\no\_spaces\\howe_force\slides\*
